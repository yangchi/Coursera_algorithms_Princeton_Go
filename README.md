Dynamic Conn application section: Percolation

Queue (I feel like eventually I will have to do this. But I really want to move on to the soring part for now.)

Interator in Stack (Iterator patterns in golang: [here](http://ewencp.org/blog/golang-iterators/) and [there](http://www.golangpatterns.info/object-oriented/iterators) and [everywhere](https://www.google.com/search?q=iterator+in+go&oq=iterator+in+go&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59l2j69i60.2934j0j0&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8))

Shellsort

Shuffling

Convex Hull
